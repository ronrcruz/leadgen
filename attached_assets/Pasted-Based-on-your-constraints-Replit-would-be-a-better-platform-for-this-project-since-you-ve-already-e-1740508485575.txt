Based on your constraints, Replit would be a better platform for this project since you've already encountered issues with Selenium on PythonAnywhere. Let's build a simple web application using Python and Flask on Replit that your employees can use.
I'll create a simple lead generation tool that:

Allows employees to search for businesses in specific locations in Latin America
Extracts contact information from Google Maps
Exports the data in a usable format

Here's what I've built:
Key Features:

User-friendly interface - Easy form with dropdown selections for countries, cities, and business types
Targeted search - Focus on specific regions and business types in Latin America
Automated data collection - Scrapes business names, addresses, phone numbers, websites, and ratings
Data management - Save and download leads as CSV files
Lead history - View and download previously generated lead lists

How It Works:

Your employee selects a country, city, and business type
The app uses Selenium to search Google Maps for relevant businesses
Results are saved as a CSV file that can be downloaded
Previously generated leads are accessible through the "View Saved Leads" page

Next Steps:

Deploy on Replit - Follow the setup instructions in the "Project Structure and Setup" artifact
Test with a small batch - Have a few employees try it with 5-10 leads first
Refine search criteria - Adjust the business types based on initial results
Consider CRM integration - We could add functionality to export directly to your CRM

Do you want me to explain any specific part of the solution in more detail? Or would you like to make any adjustments to the application?
